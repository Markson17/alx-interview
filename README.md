# alx-interview

This repository contains the following files for the ALX interview:

## 1. 0x00-pascal_triangle

This directory contains code related to Pascal's Triangle. It might include solutions or implementations of algorithms to generate and manipulate Pascal's Triangle.

## 2. 0x01-lockboxes

Inside this directory, you can find code related to Lockboxes. This may include algorithms or functions that check whether all the boxes in a given set of lockboxes can be unlocked or not.

## 3. 0x03-log_parsing

This directory holds code related to Log Parsing. It may include scripts or programs to parse and extract information from log files, perform analysis, or solve log-related problems.


## 4. 0x04UTF-8 Validation

This Python script, `0-validate_utf8.py`, implements a method that determines whether a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. It takes a list of integers as input, where each integer represents 1 byte of data (8 least significant bits). The script validates the UTF-8 encoding based on the following rules:

- A character in UTF-8 can be 1 to 4 bytes long.
- The data set can contain multiple characters.


## 5. 0x05-nqueens

The N queens puzzle is a classic chess problem that involves placing N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard. The challenge is to find all possible solutions for this problem.

Please refer to each directory for specific information and further details on the files and code contained within.

Thank you for visiting! Happy coding!

## 0x06-Starwars_api

This script is designed to retrieve and display all characters from a specific Star Wars movie using the Star Wars API. It takes a Movie ID as a positional argument and then fetches the character data associated with that movie from the API's `/films/` endpoint. The script utilizes the `request` module to make API calls and then prints out the character names in the same order as the `characters` list in the `/films/` endpoint.

## 0x07-rotate_2d_matrix

This repository contains a Python script that implements a function to rotate a given n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. The matrix is rotated in-place, and the function is designed to modify the matrix directly without returning anything.

## 0x08-making_change

This repository contains a Python script that implements an algorithm for solving the problem of making change using the fewest number of coins. Given a pile of coins of different values and a target amount total, the script determines the minimum number of coins required to meet the total using the available coin denominations.

## 0x09-island_perimeter

This repository contains a Python script that calculates the perimeter of an island described in a grid.
